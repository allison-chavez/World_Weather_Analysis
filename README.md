# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to help Jack develop features with the PlanMyTrip app in order to get different and better customer usage when trip planning. The projects main development was to use API callings, weather maps, google maps, and other skills to facilitate the app for users who are going on trips using this app. This app allows one to view hotels, weather, and travel destination preferences to complete and customize their trip and itinerary. 
Through this app we were able to give the user the ability to customize their trip based on city, country, max and minimum temperatures.
